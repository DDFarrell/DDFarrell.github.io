		<h1 class="gwc_h">Girls Who Code:</h1>
		<p>Girls Who Code is a non-profit organization that aims to increase the amount of women in the computer science field. Every summer, they host the Summer Immersion Program which teaches high school girls different coding languages at big company offices, such as Twitter, Sephora, and Square, for 7 weeks.</p>

		<h2>Week 1: Scratch</h2>

		<p>Scratch is a free visual programming language that is used to help lift programmers to more advanced levels. While using Scratch, we created games such as Paddle Ball (or Block Breaker), Pig, and an MP3 Player.</p>

		<h2>Week 2: Python</h2>

		<p>Python is a high-level, general-purpose programming level. While using Python, we made Mad Libs, a Text Adventure, and a Random Generator.</p>

		<h2>Week 3: Pygame and Object-Oriented Programming</h2>

		<p>While using Pygame, we continued using Python and made things like City Scroller, Snow Scene (City Scroller and Snow Scene are pictured above), and a ball that bounces around the screen.</p>

		<h2>Week 4: Arduino and Robotics</h2>

		<p>Arduino is a hardware and software company that makes DIY kits that make robots (pictured above) that can be controlled by their software. While using Arduino, we made them "dance" and move through mazes.</p>
